# IoT

The system aims to detect the presence of combustible gases and smoke using a gas sensor to increase safety and prevent fires and casualties in homes, offices, etc.

- It can be integrated into a system capable of activating fire hydrants in case of medium danger (flashing orange LED) and calling firefighters in case of high danger, with a presence of a red LED and a loud sound.
- It can be used in schools for greater safety in case of a fire, or simply to prevent students from smoking in prohibited areas, by adding, for example, a camera capable of Person Detection/Re-identification.
- It can also be used in forests to prevent the spread of fires, by associating the detector with a fire hydrant that can be activated upon notification.
